# MyRecipeApp
This is the first version of MyRecipeApp.  It satisfies two needs:
1) I wanted to improve my PHP
2) I wanted to store recipes on line.

Development has stopped, but I learned a lot.
MyRecipeApp version two development has started with nodejs on the back end.  The front end is expected to be a SPA, probably using React.
